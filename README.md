# ReactNativeDemo

This is a demo project with the source code of the [React Native - First Steps](https://codeoverload.io/blog/react-native-first-steps) post on the [code Overload blog](https://codeoverload.io/blog).

This repository contains a simple mobile application, where the user is able to add or remove itens from a list. See the [blog post](https://codeoverload.io/blog/react-native-first-steps) for an in-depth, step-by-step guide on how to build this application.
